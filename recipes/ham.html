            <ul>
                <li>1 (12 pound) - Bone-in Ham, Rump Portion</li>
                <li>1/2 Cup - Whole Cloves</li>
                <li>1 Cup - Brown Sugar, Packed</li>
                <li>4 Cups - Water, or as needed</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Place ham in a large roasting pan; press cloves into the top at 1- to 2-inch intervals.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Pack the top with a layer of brown sugar.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Pour enough water into the bottom of the roasting pan to come to a 1-inch depth; cover the pan tightly with aluminum foil.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Bake in the preheated oven for 4 1/2 to 5 hours. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center, making sure it is not touching the bone, should read at least 160 degrees F (72 degrees C).</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 5</h3>
