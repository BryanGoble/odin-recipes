                <li>1/2 Cup - Fresh Bread Crumbs</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp - Minced Garlic</li>
                <li>2 Tbsp - Chopped Fresh Rosemary</li>
                <li>2 tsp - Salt</li>
                <li>1 1/4 tsp - Black Pepper</li>
                <li>4 Tbsp - Olive Oil</li>
                <li>1 (7 Bone) - Rack of Lamb, Trimmed and Frenched</li>
                <li>1 Tbsp - Dijon Mustard</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 1</h3>
                    <p>Preheat the oven to 450 degrees F. Move the oven rack to the center position.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 2</h3>
                    <p>Combine bread crumbs, garlic, rosemary, 1 teaspoon salt, and 1/4 teaspoon pepper in a small bowl; stir in 2 tablespoons olive oil to moisten the mixture. Set aside.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 3</h3>
                    <p>Season rack of lamb all over with 1 teaspoon salt and 1 teaspoon pepper. Heat 2 tablespoons olive oil in a large heavy oven-proof skillet over high heat. Add lamb and sear on all sides, about 1 to 2 minutes: set lamb aside for a few minutes. Brush lamb with mustard and roll in bread crumb mixture until evenly coated. Cover the ends of the bones with foil to prevent charring.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <h3>Step 4</h3>
                    <p>Arrange the breaded rack of lamb bone-side down in the same skillet. Roast in preheated oven for 12 to 18 minutes for medium; an instant-read thermometer inserted into the center should read at least 130 degrees F (54 degrees C), or continue to cook to desired doneness. Remove lamb from the skillet and allow to rest for 5 to 7 minutes, loosely covered with foil, before carving between the ribs.</p>
