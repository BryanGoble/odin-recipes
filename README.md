## About the Project
This project serves as proof of my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS taught to me through this course. So far, we've covered a very elementary understanding of HTML5 and some elements, such as, div, a, img, p, and headings (h1-h6).

I have built many other personal websites before, so I'd consider myself to be at the _advanced_ beginner stage and plan to showcase that. I'm not a designer or creative in any sense, so any constructive criticism on where I can improve my code or design is always appreciated!
