## About the Project
This project serves as proof of my basic knowledge of HTML and CSS taught to me through this course. So far, we've covered a very elementary understanding of HTML5 and some elements, such as, div, a, img, p, and headings (h1-h6).
<br>
<br>
I have built many other personal websites before, so I'd consider myself to be at the _advanced_ beginner stage and plan to showcase that. I'm not a designer or creative in any sense, so any constructive criticism on where I can improve my code or design is always appreciated!

## What I Learned :writing_hand:
I've learned a lot so far, not just about HTML or CSS, but also myself with areas that I need to improve in. I went a little overboard and got a little too zealous thinking I could create the next Apple homepage with this project, _not literally_. Eventually, I caught myself and had to re-read the directions to get back on track with what I _really_ needed to do vice just what I wanted to accomplish.

<br>
At the beginning of this course, the Pomodoro Technique was mentioned which I had never heard of. I'm a very hyperfocused individual when I need/want to get something specific done, but have realized it only hurts me in the long run due to burnout. I looked into it more, added a new chrome extension to my toolbar, started the timer, and got to work. I have to say this was probably the biggest change I've seen in my mental well-being while learning/working in a while. I'll definitely be keeping this technique in mind when I head into work on Monday.

### Accomplish Later :hammer:
- Make site fully responsive
- Correct issue with images not resizing the way I would like
- Add recipe prep and cook times
